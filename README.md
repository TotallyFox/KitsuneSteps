PATRONS: Please do keep this repository to yourself and other patrons. I'd like to not have to add everyone here individually, so easiest way is to just keep this public and only send it to y'all. Thank you <3

Hiya! First wanna say thanks for supporting me! I always appreciate it <3
Second! This repository will NOT be updated. This is a one-time upload of my assets and project settings for reference and viewing

There are visual assets included as well, HOWEVER, please do NOT use them for releasing any projects unless I give explicit permission to you directly. Otherwise, feel free to use everything for personal use, and reference any code you need~
(Also I apologize for the horrid organization of my .cs files. I was working with time on the mind, not clean files)

If you have any questions about anything I've written or made in this project, don't hesitate to reach out~
